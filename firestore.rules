/**
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership security model for the CASHCHA application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * The fundamental principle is that users have complete control over their own data, and no
 * one else can access it. All data is considered private to the user who created it.
 * There are no public collections or admin roles defined in this ruleset.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The data is organized hierarchically. All user-specific information, including their
 * profile, withdrawal history, and captcha submissions, is nested under a top-level
 * `/users/{userId}` path. This structure ensures that ownership is clear and can be
 * enforced directly through the document path.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Strict Ownership: All rules are based on the authenticated user's UID (`request.auth.uid`)
 *   matching the `{userId}` parameter in the document path.
 * - No Public Data: All collections are private. Read and write access is restricted
 *   to the document owner.
 * - User Enumeration Disabled: Listing documents from the top-level `/users` collection
 *   is explicitly disallowed to prevent scraping user data.
 * - Relational Integrity: On document creation, rules validate that the internal `userId`
 *   or `id` field matches the `userId` from the path, ensuring data consistency. On update,
 *   these ownership fields are enforced as immutable.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * This ruleset leverages path-based security, which is an implicit form of denormalization.
 * The user's ID is part of the document path (e.g., `/users/USER_A/withdrawals/W_123`),
 * making ownership checks extremely fast and efficient without needing to read other documents.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * The data model naturally segregates each user's data into its own document tree.
 * This is a highly secure and performant pattern, as queries for a user's private data
 * (like their withdrawals) are inherently scoped to their own subcollection.
